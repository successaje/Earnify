          question: "What is Earnify?",
          answer: "Earnify is a decentralized platform on the Internet Computer blockchain that connects freelancers with job opportunities and bounties. It enables users to earn cryptocurrency for completing tasks and projects, with all transactions secured by blockchain technology."
        },
        {
          question: "What are Bounties?",
          answer: "A bounty is a competitive task where multiple participants submit their work, and the best submission(s) receive rewards. Think of it as a contest where everyone attempts the same scope of work. Bounties are a great way to build your portfolio while earning cryptocurrency for excellent work."
        },
        {
          question: "What are Job Listings?",
          answer: "A job listing is an advertisement for hiring a freelancer, where applicants fill out a custom application form and the best applicant(s) get selected to complete the work. Unlike bounties, only the selected applicant(s) complete the scope of work."
        },
        {
          question: "What is the difference between Bounties and Job Listings?",
          answer: "The main difference is the number of people who complete the work. In bounties, multiple people submit their work, and the best submission(s) win. For job listings, only the selected person/team completes the work. Bounties are competitive, while job listings are more traditional hiring processes."

        },
        {
          question: "What is the payout process for completed work?",
          answer: "Payments are processed automatically through smart contracts on the Internet Computer blockchain. Once work is verified as complete, the payment is transferred directly to your wallet. For bounties, payments are made to the winning submission(s) after the sponsor reviews and selects the winners."
        },
        {
          question: "Is KYC required to receive payments?",
          answer: "For most transactions on Earnify, KYC is not required as we leverage the Internet Computer's secure identity system. However, some sponsors may have their own requirements depending on their internal processes."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does it take to receive payments?",
          answer: "For completed jobs, payments are typically processed within 24 hours after verification. For bounties, the timeline varies based on the scope of work and number of submissions, but sponsors are encouraged to review and announce winners within 7 days after the deadline."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I change my wallet address?",
          answer: "Yes, you can update your wallet address in your profile settings at any time. The wallet address in your profile at the time of payment will be used for transactions."
        },
        {
          question: "Who reviews submissions for bounties?",
          answer: "The sponsors of the listings conduct the reviews and select the winners. Earnify provides the platform and smart contracts to facilitate the process, but the evaluation criteria and selection are determined by the sponsor."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I stay updated on new listings?",
          answer: "You can enable notifications for specific categories or listings by clicking the 'Notify Me' button. You'll receive alerts when new opportunities match your interests or when there are updates to listings you're following."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I submit to a bounty or apply for a job?",
          answer: "Sign up with Internet Identity ‚Üí complete your profile ‚Üí browse listings ‚Üí click 'Apply' or 'Submit' on the listing you're interested in. Follow the instructions provided by the sponsor to complete your application or submission."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I receive confirmation of my application?",
          answer: "Yes, you'll receive a confirmation email and a notification in your dashboard when your application or submission is successfully received."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I edit my submission after submitting?",
          answer: "Yes, you can edit your submission until the deadline of the listing has passed. After the deadline, submissions are locked for review."
